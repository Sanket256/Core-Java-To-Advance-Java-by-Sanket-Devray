# Core-Java-To-Advance-Java-by-Sanket-Devray

Certainly! Here's a brief explanation for each of the topics listed:

Basic Java
Introduction to Java
History and Features of Java:

History: Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) and released in 1995. It was designed to have the "write once, run anywhere" capability.
Features: Object-oriented, platform-independent, simple, secure, robust, portable, multithreaded, high performance, and distributed.
Setting up the Java Development Kit (JDK):

The JDK includes tools for developing and testing Java programs. You can download it from Oracle's official website or other sources like OpenJDK.
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Virtual Machine (JVM):

JRE: Provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java.
JVM: An engine that provides a runtime environment to execute Java bytecode. It is platform-dependent.
Basic Syntax
Structure of a Java Program (Classes, Methods):

Every Java program has at least one class and a main method. The class name must match the file name.
Example:
java
Copy code
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
Writing and Running Your First Java Program (Hello World):

Save the code in a file named HelloWorld.java.
Compile the program using javac HelloWorld.java.
Run the compiled bytecode using java HelloWorld.
Data Types and Variables
Primitive Data Types:

byte: 8-bit integer.
short: 16-bit integer.
int: 32-bit integer.
long: 64-bit integer.
float: Single-precision 32-bit floating point.
double: Double-precision 64-bit floating point.
char: Single 16-bit Unicode character.
boolean: Represents true or false.
Non-Primitive Data Types:

Strings: Sequences of characters.
java
Copy code
String message = "Hello, World!";
Arrays: Containers that hold multiple values of the same type.
java
Copy code
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
Classes: User-defined data types.
Variables: Declaring and Initializing Variables:

Declaring: int number;
Initializing: number = 10;
Combined: int number = 10;
Constants Using final:

final int MAX_VALUE = 100; // MAX_VALUE cannot be changed.
Operators
Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %

java
Copy code
int sum = 5 + 3; // 8
Relational Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

java
Copy code
boolean isEqual = (5 == 3); // false
Logical Operators: &&, ||, !

java
Copy code
boolean result = (5 > 3) && (3 < 4); // true
Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>

java
Copy code
int bitwiseAnd = 5 & 3; // 1
Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

java
Copy code
int a = 5;
a += 3; // a is now 8
Unary Operators: +, -, ++, --, !

java
Copy code
int b = 5;
b++; // b is now 6
Ternary Operator: ? :

java
Copy code
int min = (a < b) ? a : b;
Control Flow Statements
Decision Making:

if:
java
Copy code
if (a > b) {
    System.out.println("a is greater than b");
}
if-else:
java
Copy code
if (a > b) {
    System.out.println("a is greater than b");
} else {
    System.out.println("a is not greater than b");
}
switch:
java
Copy code
int day = 2;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Other day");
}
Looping:

for:
java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
while:
java
Copy code
int j = 0;
while (j < 5) {
    System.out.println(j);
    j++;
}
do-while:
java
Copy code
int k = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(k);
    k++;
} while (k < 5);
Branching:

break: Exits the loop or switch statement.
java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) break;
    System.out.println(i);
}
continue: Skips the current iteration of the loop.
java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) continue;
    System.out.println(i);
}
return: Exits from the current method and optionally returns a value.
java
Copy code
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
Conclusion
This overview covers the essential basics of Java, including its introduction, syntax, data types, variables, operators, and control flow statements. Mastering these foundational concepts will provide a solid base for further learning in Java programming.

how to connect eclipse with git hub

ChatGPT
Connecting Eclipse with GitHub allows you to manage your code repositories directly from the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you set up and connect Eclipse with GitHub:

Prerequisites
Eclipse IDE: Make sure you have Eclipse installed on your computer. You can download it from the Eclipse official website.
Git: Ensure that Git is installed on your computer. You can download it from the Git official website.
GitHub Account: You need a GitHub account. You can create one for free at GitHub.
Steps to Connect Eclipse with GitHub
Step 1: Install the EGit Plugin
EGit is the Git integration for Eclipse. It should be included by default in the latest versions of Eclipse, but if it's not, you can install it manually.

Open Eclipse.
Go to Help > Eclipse Marketplace.
In the Eclipse Marketplace, search for "EGit".
Click on Go, and then Install the EGit - Git Integration for Eclipse plugin.
Follow the installation instructions and restart Eclipse when prompted.
Step 2: Configure Git in Eclipse
Open Eclipse and go to Window > Preferences.
Expand the Team node and select Git.
Configure your user information:
User Name: Your GitHub username.
User Email: The email associated with your GitHub account.
Click Apply and Close.
Step 3: Clone a Repository from GitHub
Open Eclipse.
Go to File > Import.
Select Git > Projects from Git and click Next.
Select Clone URI and click Next.
In the Source Git Repository page, fill in the following:
URI: The URL of the GitHub repository (you can find this on your GitHub repository page).
Host: The host of the GitHub repository (e.g., github.com).
Repository Path: The path to the repository (e.g., /username/repositoryname).
Protocol: Select https or ssh depending on how you access your GitHub repositories.
Enter your GitHub username and password (or set up an SSH key if using SSH).
Click Next, then select the branches you want to clone and click Next again.
Choose a local directory to clone the repository to and click Finish.
Step 4: Create a New Project and Commit Changes
Once the repository is cloned, it will appear in the Git Repositories view.
Right-click on the repository and select Import Projects.
Follow the prompts to import the project into your workspace.
Make changes to the project as needed.
To commit changes, go to the Git Staging view:
Add files to the staging area by dragging them from Unstaged Changes to Staged Changes.
Enter a commit message.
Click Commit or Commit and Push to commit the changes locally or push them to GitHub, respectively.
Step 5: Push Changes to GitHub
If you chose Commit in the previous step, you now need to push your changes to GitHub.
Right-click on your project in the Project Explorer view.
Select Team > Push to Upstream.
Follow the prompts to push your commits to the remote repository on GitHub.
